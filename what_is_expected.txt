We expect from candidates a runnable Python script that summarize the data analysis of the dataset. 

The script should include comments that explain the methodology. 

We expect a balance between performance, methodology, explanation, code quality and usability, suitable for a real world data science implementations.

Python is preferred but R is accepted.

See "challenge_description.txt" for the dataset and challenge explanation.
